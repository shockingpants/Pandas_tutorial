""" 10min pandas tutorial

Introduction
=============
This tutorial introduces the user to **Pandas** usage. Additionally, the code is
written in Markup language syntax so that we can generate documentation for the
script with Sphinx automatically. There will also be a few examples to
demonstrate how ipynb notebooks can be generated and uploaded. Lastly, the code
will be uploaded to github to demonstrate the process of version control and
file/documentation sharing. Links to the guides can be found in the
:ref:`resource` section.
